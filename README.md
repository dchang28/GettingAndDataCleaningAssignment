# Getting and Data Cleaning - Coursera Project Assignment#
This was a course project for the Coursera Getting and Data Cleaning class. The R script will take data from the [data source](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and output a tidy data file meeting the assignment criteria.

##Assignment##

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Instructions##

The data set used for this analysis can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). The zipped filed should be saved as "data' and unzipped into the working directory of the R script. Files within the unzipped data set do not need to be moved as long as the original zipped file was properly named.

Once files are downloaded, run the run_analysis.R script, which will generate the output tidy_data.txt
